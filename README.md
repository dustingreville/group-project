## Here are some of the features: 

# Library:

We have the library page which allows users to explore and search for non-copyrighted music tracks. It serves as a central hub where users can view available songs, filter them by genre, title, and artist, and listen to them directly from the site. The search functionality makes it easy for users to find specific tracks, while the overall design is user-friendly and organized to enhance the browsing experience

# Upload Page:

The upload page allows users to easily upload their non-copyrighted music files to the platform. Users can select a file from their local device and provide details such as the title, artist name, and genre. Once the form is completed, the file is uploaded and added to the music library, where others can search and listen to it

The rest like the homepage, feed etc are pretty unfinished or just basic. The homepage is just a hello welcome. Since its not the group making the entire thing together a lot isnt as finsihed as it should be or could be.
